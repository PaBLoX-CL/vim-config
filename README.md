Colorschemes
============

If you want to include the extra colorschemes, just add the following in
your `before.vimrc` file:

    let g:colorscheme_extras = 1

Key-stuff
=========

I have added some alt + key mappings, if you need to add more, just modify
the `characters` list from [](rc/alt_mappings.rc.vim).

For [termite](https://github.com/thestinger/termite), I have configured the
support for `<S-F1>` to `<S-F4>`.

This [answer](https://stackoverflow.com/a/27206531/417527) on StackOverflow
explains how it is done.
